## 📂 Expected Folder Structure

After downloading and extracting the dataset, the directory should be organized as follows:

```
dataset/
├── raw/            # Original PCB images
├── annotations/    # Labels / annotations for defects and components
├── train/          # Training data
├── val/            # Validation data
└── test/           # Testing data
```

> ⚠️ Folder names may vary depending on the model or framework used. Ensure consistency with the configuration files in the main project.
